## GiftGrub (CEN3031Team9)

**A web app for simplifying your charitable giving experience.**

### Problem

Many people want to donate to charities that support causes they care about, but finding reputable organizations and aligning them with one's values can be difficult. Searching through pages of charities can be daunting or altogether prohibitive, leading people to forgo their desire to give back.

### Solution

GiftGrub is a web app that simplifies the donation process by:

* **Seamlessly filtering charities by multiple causes:** Unlike Charity Navigator, GiftGrub allows you to combine multiple tags (e.g., environment, education, animal welfare) to refine your search and find charities that align perfectly with your values.
* **Storing payment details for easy donations:** No need to re-enter your information every time! GiftGrub securely stores your payment details for faster and more convenient donations.
* **Directly donating through the app:** Give back with just a few clicks! Skip the hassle of navigating individual charity websites and donate directly through GiftGrub.
* **Requesting the addition of specific charities:** Don't see your favorite organization listed? We encourage you to request its addition to our platform.
* **Providing dedicated customer support:** Have any questions or feedback? Our friendly customer support team is here to assist you.
